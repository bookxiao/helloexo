# HelloExo

HelloExo is a ExoPlayer demo which you can enter an arbitrary url to play.

This implement is based on [ExoPlayer official demo application](https://exoplayer.dev/demo-application.html).

Compared to official demo, which reads uri list from `asserts/*.exolist.json` and allows user to select one to play, HelloExo allows user to enter url directly.
